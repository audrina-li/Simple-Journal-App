# A Simple Journaling App

**Feature**: <br>
Allow the users to create journals in short periods of time using different timeline templates.

**Target Audience**: <br>
People who would like to keep track of their daily lives but do not plan to devote much time on it.

Making journals could be time-consuming and hard to keep up, 
therefore I would like to design an application that could make this process a little easier.
