# A Simple Journaling App

**Feature**: <br>
Allow the users to create journals in short periods of time using different timeline templates.

**Target Audience**: <br>
People who would like to keep track of their daily lives but do not plan to devote much time on it.

**Designing Purpose**: <br>
Making journals could be time-consuming and hard to keep up, 
therefore I would like to design an application that could make this process a little easier.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to create a new journal and add events to it
- As a user, I want to be able to mark an event as the highlight of the day
- As a user, I want to be able to delete an existing journal
- As a user, I want to be able to select a journal and view a list of events in it
- As a user, I want to be able to select and save a journal to file
- As a user, I want to be able to select and load a journal from file 

## Phase 4: Task 2
Make use of the Map interface in the JournalAppGUI class. 

## Phase 4: Task 3
- split up the JournalAppGUI class to improve cohesion
(could possibly move some of the fields and methods into new classes such as NewFile, OpenFile, SaveFile and LoadFile)
- extract more helper methods to improve readability
